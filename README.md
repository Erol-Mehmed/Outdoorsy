### General Information:

I have created the project with npx create-react-app my-app.
I have used React.js and JavaScript.

### Note:

To use the search functionality of the app you must send the request from USA location.
This can be done via VPN.

### If I had a whole week to work on this:

If I had a whole week I would have made a registration and login functionalities so that the user can save his favorite search results.
I would have made a second view in which you can see your favorites in the form of a catalog.
